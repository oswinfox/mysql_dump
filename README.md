# mysql_dump
script to dump mysql db's

THis script was made with the help of: 

* [username and password in MYSQL](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/69598/how-can-i-mysqldump-all-databases-except-the-mysql-schema)
* [search all db an exclude db](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/35081/any-option-for-mysqldump-to-ignore-databases-for-backup/35104)

The idea here is to dump all your db's in a file. You can add excepetion to some db's you do not need to dump.
